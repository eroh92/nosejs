# NoseJS
> Version 0.9.5 (unreleased)

# What

NoseJS is a [Nose](http://www.somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/)
plugin for integrating JavaScript tests into a Python test suite.

This projected has been forked from
[NoseJS on BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org/kumar303/nosejs).

# Overview

NoseJS is designed for Python projects that require JavaScript code for some
Web functionality. It currently has two features:

- Discover and run JavaScript tests alongside Python tests
- Validate JavaScript syntax (check for lint).

# Install

There are some optional external dependencies in the sections below.

#Checking JavaScript Syntax

NoseJS will find JavaScript files (e.g. ``app.js``) along the Nose path and run them through the `jsl`_ command line tool to check for "lint."  In other words, show you syntax errors, warnings, etc.  You can install jsl on most systems using your package manager (i.e. ``port install javascript-lint`` on Mac OS X) otherwise it is available for download on the `jsl`_ site.  

.. _jsl: http://www.javascriptlint.com/

## Usage

To check for lint without running any JavaScript unit tests, type::
    
    $ nosetests --with-javascript --no-javascript-tests path/to/javascript

To disable lint checking, add ``--no-javascript-lint``

# Running JavaScript Tests

NoseJS will also find and run JavaScript test files, those that match Nose's test pattern and end in ``.js``.  Currently, NoseJS supports running executing tests in `Rhino`_, a Java implementation of the JavaScript language.  There is experimental support for `python-spidermonkey <http://github.com/davisp/python-spidermonkey/tree/master>`_ using the ``--spidermonkey`` switch.

## Usage

Assuming you've downloaded `Rhino`_ into ``~/src``, discover and run JavaScript tests with this command::
    
    $ nosetests --with-javascript --rhino-jar ~/src/rhino1_7R1/js.jar path/to/javascript/tests

This command would look for any files along Nose's path ending in .js that match Nose's current test pattern, collect them all, then execute them using Rhino in a single Java subprocess at the end of all other tests.  By default, files looking like ``test*.js`` will be collected and run.

The idea behind NoseJS is that you might have a Python web application that relies on JavaScript for some of its functionality and you want to run both Python and JavaScript tests with one command, `nosetests <http://www.somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/>`_.  You can put these JavaScript tests wherever you want in your project.

Here is a more realistic example that shows how the `Fudge <http://farmdev.com/projects/fudge/>`_ project is tested simultaneously for Python and JavaScript functionality.  Its project layout looks roughly like this::

    |-- fudge
    |   |-- __init__.py
    |   |-- patcher.py
    |   |-- tests
    |   |   |-- __init__.py
    |   |   |-- test_fudge.py
    |   |   |-- test_patcher.py
    |-- javascript
    |   |-- fudge
    |   |   |-- fudge.js
    |   |   |-- tests
    |   |   |   |-- test_fudge.html
    |   |   |   `-- test_fudge.js
    `-- setup.py

Both Python and JavaScript tests can be run with this command::
    
    $ nosetests  --with-javascript \
                 --rhino-jar ~/src/rhino1_7R1/js.jar \
                 --with-dom \
                 --javascript-dir javascript/fudge/tests/
    ......................................................

The dots are the Python tests that were run and the output below that is what Fudge's JavaScript test files printed out.  Be sure to read the Caveats section below ;)

## Specifying a path to JavaScript files

If JavaScript files are nested in a subdirectory, like the above example, specify that directory with::
    
    $ nosetests --with-javascript --javascript-dir javascript/fudge/tests/ --javascript-dir ./another/dir

## nosejs JavaScript namespace

All JavaScripts have the ``nosejs`` JavaScript namespace available for use.  The following methods are available:

- **nosejs.requireFile(path)**
  
  - Load a JavaScript file from your test script.  If you require the same file multiple times, it will only 
    be loaded once.  If the file does not start with a slash, then it should be a path relative to the directory 
    of the script where requireFile() was called from.  For example, here is how test_fudge.js requires the 
    fudge library before testing::
        
        if (typeof nosejs !== 'undefined') {
            nosejs.requireFile("../fudge.js");
        }

- **nosejs.requireResource(name)**
  
  - Require a JavaScript file that is bundled with NoseJS.  There are a few available resources:
    
    jquery-1.3.1.js
        Will load the `JQuery <http://jquery.com/>`_ library before loading any other tests

    jquery/qunit-testrunner.js
        Will load a very minimal set of JavaScript functions for testing.  It is a partial implementation of the `QUnit test runner <http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit>`_ interface.  
        Supported methods: module(), test(), equals(), ok(), and expect()
    
    For example, test_fudge.js uses jquery and the testrunner ::
    
        if (typeof nosejs !== 'undefined') {
            nosejs.requireResource("jquery-1.3.1.js");
            nosejs.requireResource("jquery/qunit-testrunner.js");
            nosejs.requireFile("../fudge.js");
        }

## Using the DOM

If your JavaScript under test relies on a browser-like DOM environment, it might still work!  Just run::
    
    $ nosetests --with-javascript --with-dom

This will load a copy of John Resig's `env.js <http://ejohn.org/projects/bringing-the-browser-to-the-server/>`_ script to simulate a DOM before loading any other JavaScript.  There are a few very minor patches made to env.js, marked with @@nosejs in the NoseJS source.

## Caveats

- Currently if JavaScript tests fail, nosetests **will not** indicate failure and its exit status will be unaffected.  I can't figure out a clean way to do this.  Please get in touch if you'd like to help.  
- In general, JavaScript tests are not very well integrated into Nose.

## Wait ... Python *and* Java?

`Rhino`_ is pretty much the only stable, command line oriented implementation of JavaScript I know of and it's well supported by Mozilla.  

Alternatively, John J. Lee created a Python binding to the fast `Spider Monkey engine <http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/>`_, Atul Varma revived it once in a fork on `Google Code <http://code.google.com/p/python-spidermonkey/>`_, and now Paul J. Davis is working on it (in `git <http://github.com/davisp/python-spidermonkey/tree/master>`_ and it is released on `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-spidermonkey>`_).  

There is current experimental support for Python Spidermonkey in NoseJS using the ``--spidermonkey`` option, which switches out the JavaScript engine.
